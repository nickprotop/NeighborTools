<h2>Reset Your Password</h2>

<p>Hi @Model.UserName,</p>

<p>
    We received a request to reset the password for your NeighborTools account. 
    If you didn't make this request, you can safely ignore this email.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>ðŸ”’ Security Notice:</strong> This password reset link will expire in 
    <strong>@Model.ExpiresInHours hours</strong> for your security.
</div>

<p>To reset your password, click the button below:</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
    <a href="@Model.ResetUrl" class="button">
        Reset My Password
    </a>
</div>

<p style="font-size: 14px; color: #6c757d;">
    If the button doesn't work, you can copy and paste this link into your browser:
</p>
<p style="word-break: break-all; font-size: 14px; color: #594AE2;">
    @Model.ResetUrl
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Didn't Request This?</h3>

<p>
    If you didn't request a password reset, someone may have entered your email address by mistake. 
    Your password hasn't been changed, and you can safely ignore this email.
</p>

<p>
    For added security, we recommend:
</p>

<ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li>Using a unique, strong password for your NeighborTools account</li>
    <li>Enabling two-factor authentication in your <a href="@Model.BaseUrl/settings/security">security settings</a></li>
    <li>Reviewing your recent account activity</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you have any concerns about your account security, please
