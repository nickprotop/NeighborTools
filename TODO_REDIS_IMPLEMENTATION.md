# Redis Implementation TODO

## Current Status
Redis is configured in the infrastructure (Docker, appsettings.json) but not actually implemented in the codebase. The application runs without Redis functionality.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Add Redis Packages
- [ ] Add `StackExchange.Redis` package to `ToolsSharing.Infrastructure.csproj`
- [ ] Add `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis` package to `ToolsSharing.API.csproj`

### 2. Configure Redis Services
- [ ] Add Redis configuration in `Program.cs` using `AddStackExchangeRedis()`
- [ ] Register `IDistributedCache` service
- [ ] Create Redis connection configuration from appsettings

### 3. Implement Caching Services
- [ ] Create `ICacheService` interface for abstraction
- [ ] Implement `RedisCacheService` with common caching operations
- [ ] Add caching to frequently accessed data

### 4. Caching Implementation Areas

#### Tool Management
- [ ] Cache tool search results (category, location, price filters)
- [ ] Cache popular/featured tools for homepage
- [ ] Cache tool details for frequently viewed items
- [ ] Cache tool availability status

#### User Management  
- [ ] Cache user profiles and authentication state
- [ ] Cache user's tools list
- [ ] Cache user preferences and settings

#### API Performance
- [ ] Add response caching middleware for GET endpoints
- [ ] Cache aggregated data (tool counts, statistics)
- [ ] Cache dropdown/filter options (categories, locations)

#### Session Management
- [ ] Store JWT refresh tokens in Redis
- [ ] Implement distributed session storage
- [ ] Cache user permissions and roles

### 5. Advanced Redis Features
- [ ] Implement rate limiting using Redis counters
- [ ] Add Redis pub/sub for real-time notifications
- [ ] Use Redis sets for user favorites/bookmarks
- [ ] Implement search result caching with TTL

### 6. Configuration & Monitoring
- [ ] Add Redis health checks
- [ ] Configure cache expiration policies
- [ ] Add Redis connection resilience
- [ ] Implement cache warming strategies
- [ ] Add metrics and monitoring for cache hit/miss rates

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for caching services
- [ ] Integration tests with Redis container
- [ ] Performance tests comparing with/without caching
- [ ] Cache invalidation testing

## Benefits of Implementation
- **Performance**: Faster response times for frequently accessed data
- **Scalability**: Reduced database load
- **User Experience**: Quicker page loads and search results
- **Real-time Features**: Support for notifications and live updates

## Priority Order
1. **High**: Basic caching for tool searches and user data
2. **Medium**: Session management and refresh token storage  
3. **Low**: Advanced features like pub/sub and real-time notifications

## Dependencies
- Redis server (already configured in Docker)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible implementation (app should work with/without Redis)
